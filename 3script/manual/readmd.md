# Web3 Proxy Manual

## Prerequisites: Install MdBook

Use the installer:

```bash
#cd $repodirectory
bash install.sh
```

## Developing

When working on the manual folder, run `bash develop.sh`. This will open the book in the browser on port 8881, and listen for changes in the manual, and reload the book as you save your changes.

## Building

Run `bash scripts/doc.sh` to build and output the built mdbook in the docs folder. You can display the built mdbook by opening the `docs/index.html` file in your browser.
